# personal_expense_app

This was my Second Project in Flutter. And also, this was based on a video tutorial that I've watched and I also apply the functionalities and including the syntax as well.

## Features of the App

- Automated Greeting Message based on your time
- Add and Delete Transaction
- Once, you added a transaction it will automatically display to the chart bar and also calculate the total amount you've spend on that day
- Responsive and it can work into landscape mode
- For now, this application is only focused on Android not in IOS
